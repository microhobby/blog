Let's go to the 2020 retrospective. First, I will present my top 5 events of the year with comments and at the end I will list all of them.

But first a summary of the year's results:

## Summary

![2020 Review](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-summaryreview2020.png?raw=true)

> Obs: of the 24 talks/lives 7 were in English for an international audience. Of the 28 videos on Youtube, 10 were in English. English is not my native language and I do not consider myself a "good speaker" of the language. But in this year of 2020 one of the goals was to improve English, the videos on Youtube helped a lot to lose some of the shame and anxiety when using English in live talks.

### Linux Kernel Builds

My build scripts for Linux Kernel have at the end a telemetry call that record simple data: what the build's target architecture is and whether the build was successful or had errors. And here are the 2020 data results:

## My TOP 6 Events of 2020

>  ⚠️ It was supposed to be TOP 5, but I couldn't leave one out so it became TOP 6 😁

### Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 Kernel Mainline

In May I think I was the first to compile a Linux Mainline Kernel for WSL 2 (at least the first to publish something). I made a video showing the news, posted on Twitter tagging the official Ubuntu account and they retweeted the post:

 ![Ubuntu Retweet](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-ubuntutweet.PNG?raw=true)

And this was by far the video that had the most views this year on the youtube channel, today with 13955 views.

### WSL Conf 2020 Talk

In September, WSL Conf 2020 took place. It was amazing to have the opportunity to share on the topic: `Customizing Linux Kernel for WSL 2 - Tips and Tricks`

![WSL Conf Tweet](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-wslconftwett.PNG?raw=true)

It was one of the main events I attended this year. I have to confess that I was very nervous. WSL Conf brought together the big names in the WSL community, project managers from Docker, Microsoft, Ubuntu and NVIDIA. And I? I was the impostor! 🤣 But, in the end everything went well, I think I was able to share my tips and showed a very nice demo using a custom virtual GPIO/Pinctrl driver to WSL 2.

### VS Code Extension for Embedded Linux Kernel Development

In January I started to develop and published a side project, an extension of VS Code to help me with development for the embedded Linux Kernel. Although the extension [Embedded Linux Kernel Dev](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microhobby.linuxkerneldev) was published in January now in December, it already has more than 6K downloads in Visual Studio Market Place. I really didn't expect the tool to be useful to so many people 😀.

### Mentioned in the Embedded Linux Conference Europe

The great surprise of the year was the VS Code Embdded Kernel Linux extension being mentioned during the Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2020. I was super happy to see my extension in the talk `Using Visual Studio Code for Embedded Development` of the great Michael Opdenacker from Bootlin. [Link for Youtube video](https://youtu.be/ePsIEIxZs1c?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6rm6j0ZQ5m9niWyrzFJlKLH).

It is always great to receive feedback on your work, be it positive or negative, even more than a big name in the world of Embedded Linux.

### Brazilian The Developers Conference Online 2020 Talks

For me the TDC is the main technical conference here in Brazil. We have a lot of quality content for a few days. The face-to-face event is very cool, but therefore, this year it had to take place online, due to pandemic causes. I had the pleasure of participating in the TDC Online pilot plan, TDC Online BH in April, sharing about `Docker Containers for IoT and Embedded Linux`. It was one of the lives I did with more simultaneous views of the year:

![TDC BH](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-tdcbh.jpg?raw=true)

Then, I still had the opportunity to participate in TDC Online Florianópolis and São Paulo with the talks `Blazor for IoT and Embedded Linux`,`Caninos Labrador v2 - The Raspberry Pi Brasileira?` And `Did I have a Linux Kernel inside my Windows? WSL 2 and Docker with this?`:

### MVP Conf Latam 2020 Talks
 
And last but not least I had the pleasure of participating in the MVP Conf Latam 2020. The invitation to this conference was also a big surprise in the year 2020, because generally those who speak at MVP Conf, as the name already says, are the `Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals` and I am not a `Microsoft MVP`. But I was very happy to receive the invitation from MVP [Claudenir Andrade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudenirandrade/) to participate, since this year I worked and shared a lot of content about Microsoft technologies, always linked to Linux of sure. I shared three talks during the MVP Conf Latam on the IoT track:

-   Translated from Portuguese: `Developing IoT Applications with Dotnet`
![PPT dotnet iot](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-mvpconf3.PNG?raw=true)

-   Translated from Portuguese: `.NET Standard for Microcontrollers with Meadow F7`
![PPT Meadow F7](https://github.com/microhobby/blog/blob/master/img/retro-mvp2.PNG?raw=true)

-  Translated from Portuguese: `User Interfaces with .NET Core, WinUI, XAML for Linux IoT, is possible?`

## Happy 2021

2020 was difficult, challenging and in some ways incredible. For those who had the privilege of being able to work from home, we have never been so connected. The world stopped, stayed at home, but connected to the world wide web. It was a year of opportunities for me, I live in Brazil and I don't have many opportunities to participate in international events (and I am not much to travel at all). But this year I took the opportunity to participate in all events that happen online. This was important because I felt included in the global technical community and that I am not far behind who has these international opportunities. It's amazing how open information, open source and communities give us opportunities to work with what you want, when and where you want it. Even though online, I met and connected with many colleagues from the international technical community and this network is being fantastic for my career and personal life. 2020 WAS TOP despite the regrets.

Here I only show the victories, but life is a box of surprises, right? Of course, I also had my sad moments this 2020, and there were many. These results that I am happy to share were "forged in sweat and tears" 😎. But I am grateful to be alive and to have had the opportunity to do so much cool in 2020.

Anyway, I wish everyone who follows my work a happy 2021, much health and peace for you and your family!!!
